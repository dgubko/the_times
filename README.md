## About The Project

The Times Newspaper is an App that allows user to pre-view articles taken from The New York Times API. User can switch categories of the news pushing category butoons. User can choose the article from all articles list and click "Read more" button. This will bring user to a details page with a description. User can also read the full article on the official NYT Website clicking "Read full article" button.

The Times Newspaper was constructed utilizing React, Router, and Cypress testing.
